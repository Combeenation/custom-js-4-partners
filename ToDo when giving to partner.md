# ToDo when giving to partner

- Delete folder `node_modules` & `dist`
- Copy to new folder named `produkter-customjs` to match the package name
- Inside new folder:
  - Delete folder `.git` & file `.gitignore`  
    Partners don't need access to our git repo ATM. The repo is private anyway...
  - Delete this file
- Create ZIP containing the new folder
